# Setting up LLMs on CURC Resources

Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly gaining popularity due to their impressive 
performance across a wide range of discipline, from the humanities to the physical 
sciences. However, effectively utilizing LLMs often requires significant computational 
resources. This RC Short Course* is designed to help researchers take full advantage 
of CU Research Computing (CURC) resources to deploy and run LLMs efficiently. The session 
will provide a high-level overview of CURC systems suited for LLM workloads, followed by 
practical guidance on the installation, configuration, and use of popular tools such as 
Hugging Face and Ollama for downloading and running state-of-the-art models.

This session is intended for users with a basic understanding of programming and some 
familiarity with Linux command-line environment.

\* What is an RC Short Course? An RC Short Course is a training that provides an in-depth 
understanding of a concept, system, or tool. You can expect to leave a "Short Course" with 
a solid grasp of the topic.
